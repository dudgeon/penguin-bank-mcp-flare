## Implementation Notes

- Each function should handle natural language input similar to the user examples
- Responses should be conversational and include relevant details
- Functions should return structured data that can be formatted into natural language responses
- Error handling should provide helpful feedback to users
- Security considerations should be implemented for sensitive operations (payments, card management, etc.)

## Appendix: Additional Context, Tools, Prompts

### Development Context

**MCP Server Architecture:**
- Built on Cloudflare Workers platform
- TypeScript implementation
- RESTful API endpoints for each banking function
- Mock data for demonstration purposes
- Secure authentication and authorization patterns

**Target Integration:**
- Claude Desktop MCP client
- Other MCP-compatible AI assistants
- Web-based MCP playground for testing

### Development Tools

**Required Dependencies:**
```json
{
  "@cloudflare/workers-types": "^4.x",
  "typescript": "^5.x",
  "wrangler": "^3.x"
}
```

**Development Commands:**
```bash
# Local development
npm run dev

# Deploy to Cloudflare
npm run deploy

# Type checking
npm run type-check
```

**Testing Tools:**
- MCP Inspector for function testing
- Cloudflare Workers local development environment
- Claude Desktop for end-to-end testing

### Implementation Prompts

**For AI Assistant Development:**

1. **Function Implementation Prompt:**
   ```
   Implement the [FUNCTION_NAME] MCP function that:
   - Accepts natural language input: "[USER_EXAMPLE]"
   - Returns structured data for response: "[EXPECTED_RESPONSE]"
   - Includes proper error handling and validation
   - Follows banking security best practices
   ```

2. **Testing Prompt:**
   ```
   Test the [FUNCTION_NAME] function with these scenarios:
   - Happy path: "[USER_EXAMPLE]"
   - Edge cases: invalid inputs, missing data, network errors
   - Security validation: unauthorized access, malformed requests
   ```

3. **Integration Prompt:**
   ```
   Integrate [FUNCTION_NAME] with the MCP server:
   - Add function definition to MCP schema
   - Implement request/response handling
   - Add to function registry
   - Update documentation
   ```

### Mock Data Patterns

**Account Data:**
```typescript
interface AccountData {
  balance: number;
  availableCredit: number;
  creditLimit: number;
  lastUpdated: string;
}
```

**Transaction Data:**
```typescript
interface Transaction {
  id: string;
  merchant: string;
  amount: number;
  date: string;
  category: string;
  status: 'posted' | 'pending';
}
```

**Payment Data:**
```typescript
interface Payment {
  amount: number;
  scheduledDate: string;
  type: 'one-time' | 'recurring';
  status: 'scheduled' | 'processing' | 'completed';
}
```

### Security Considerations

**Authentication:**
- API key validation for MCP client connections
- Rate limiting per client/function
- Request signing for sensitive operations

**Data Protection:**
- No real financial data storage
- Encrypted data transmission
- Audit logging for all operations

**Function-Specific Security:**
- Payment functions: Amount validation, duplicate prevention
- Card management: Multi-factor authentication simulation
- Account access: Session validation, timeout handling

### Error Handling Patterns

**Standard Error Responses:**
```typescript
interface ErrorResponse {
  error: string;
  code: string;
  message: string;
  suggestions?: string[];
}
```

**Common Error Scenarios:**
- Invalid input format
- Insufficient account balance
- Network/service unavailable
- Authentication failures
- Rate limit exceeded

### Testing Scenarios

**Functional Testing:**
- Each function with exact website examples
- Boundary value testing (amounts, dates)
- Invalid input handling

**Integration Testing:**
- MCP client connection
- Function discovery and execution
- Response formatting and display

**User Experience Testing:**
- Natural language input variations
- Response clarity and helpfulness
- Error message user-friendliness
