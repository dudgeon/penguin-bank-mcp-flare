## ✅ What's Already Working
- [x] Node.js v20 installed and working
- [x] Cloudflare authenticated (dudgeon@gmail.com)
- [x] Pages project exists: `penguin-bank` 
- [x] Worker project exists: `my-mcp-server`
- [x] Manual deployments tested and working
- [x] CI/CD pipeline created and committed
- [x] All documentation created

## 🔧 Complete These 2 Steps to Finish

### Step 1: Create API Token
1. **Already opened**: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
2. Click **"Create Token"**
3. Select **"Edit Cloudflare Workers"** template
4. **Account**: Select "Dudgeon@gmail.com's Account"
5. **Zone Resources**: Include All zones
6. Click **"Continue to Summary"** → **"Create Token"**
7. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Add GitHub Secrets  
1. **Already opened**: https://github.com/dudgeon/penguin-bank-mcp-flare/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click **"New repository secret"** and add:

| Secret Name | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | The token you just created |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | `0e0a12f91d808a8536743acc49a267cf` |

## 🎯 Test the Pipeline

Once you've added the secrets:

```bash
git push origin main
```

Then check: https://github.com/dudgeon/penguin-bank-mcp-flare/actions

## 🌐 Your Live URLs

- **Pages**: https://penguin-bank.pages.dev or https://penguinbank.cloud  
- **Worker**: https://my-mcp-server.dudgeon.workers.dev
- **GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/dudgeon/penguin-bank-mcp-flare/actions

## 🎉 What Happens Next

After setup:
- ✅ Every merge to `main` automatically deploys both sites
- ✅ Pull requests get preview deployments  
- ✅ Only changed components deploy (saves time)
- ✅ Quality checks prevent broken deployments
- ✅ Clear status reporting in GitHub
