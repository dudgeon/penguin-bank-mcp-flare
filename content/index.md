SSG TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS:
This markdown file provides structured data for generating the Penguin Bank website.
An SSG should use this data to programmatically generate:

1. HERO SECTION: Use hero.taglines array for cycling text
2. CAROUSEL SECTIONS: Use carousels object to generate each section:
   - Loop through carousels.{name}.slides to create carousel-slide divs
   - Use section_id, track_id, dots_id for proper HTML IDs
   - Generate navigation arrows and dots programmatically
3. FUNCTIONS SECTION: Use functions.categories to generate function cards:
   - Loop through categories to create category divs with proper IDs
   - Loop through functions within each category for chat examples
4. FOOTER: Use footer.links and footer.copyright

REQUIRED HTML STRUCTURE FOR SSG:
- All carousel containers need: bg-{color} rounded-xl shadow-sm overflow-hidden relative mb-8
- Carousel tracks need: carousel-track class with proper ID
- Navigation needs: carousel-nav absolute positioning with onclick handlers
- Dots need: flex justify-center gap-2 pb-6 with proper ID
- Function cards need: bg-white rounded-xl p-8 shadow-sm with hover effects
- Chat containers need: max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-8 structure

JAVASCRIPT DEPENDENCIES:
- Carousel navigation functions (navigateCarousel, goToSlide, initCarousel)
- Touch/swipe event handlers for mobile
- Hero tagline cycling animation
- Copy URL functionality
- Tailwind CSS configuration with penguin color theme

EXAMPLE SSG TEMPLATE USAGE (Liquid/Nunjucks style):
